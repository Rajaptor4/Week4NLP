Conclusion\n\nUpon building a RandomForestClassifier, the model achieved an accuracy of approximately 78.3% on the validation set. The precision, recall, and f1-score in the classification report indicate a reasonably good performance, particularly in classifying the majority class (label 0) with a high recall of 0.93 and an f1-score of 0.83. However, the model showed a tendency to underperform when predicting the minority class (label 1), with a lower recall of 0.60. This suggests that while the model is quite adept at identifying the majority class, it struggles somewhat with the minority class, which could be due to class imbalance or other factors not captured by the features.\n\nThe macro-average f1-score of 0.77, while not indicative of a highly imbalanced model, does signal room for improvement, possibly through techniques such as resampling, more advanced feature extraction, or model tuning","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"test_data = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/nlp-getting-started/test.csv')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.580916Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.581260Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.581076Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.581091Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"X_test = vectorizer.transform(test_data['text'])\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.583009Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.583398Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.583195Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.583233Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"test_predictions = clf.predict(X_test)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.584476Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.584802Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.584643Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.584657Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(len(test_predictions))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.586131Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.586468Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.586308Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.586323Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"submission = pd.DataFrame({ 'id': test_data['id'], 'target': test_predictions })\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.587497Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.587812Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.587656Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.587670Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"submission.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.588893Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.589218Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.589045Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-10T16:12:42.589059Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
